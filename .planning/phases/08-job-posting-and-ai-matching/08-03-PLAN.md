<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create job server actions and form component</name>
  <files>src/actions/jobs.ts, src/components/jobs/job-form.tsx</files>
  <action>
**In `src/actions/jobs.ts`:**

Add `'use server'` directive at top.

Define Zod validation schemas:

```typescript
const CreateJobSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, 'Title is required').max(255),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  requiredSpecializations: z.array(z.string()).min(1, 'At least one required specialization'),
  preferredSpecializations: z.array(z.string()).optional().default([]),
  minimumExperience: z.coerce.number().int().min(0).optional(),
  preferredLocation: z.string().max(255).optional(),
  requiredBar: z.array(z.string()).optional().default([]),
  requiredTechnicalDomains: z.array(z.string()).optional().default([]),
})
```

Export 3 server actions:

1. `createJobAction(prevState: ActionState | undefined, formData: FormData): Promise<ActionState>` where `ActionState = { success?: boolean; error?: string; jobId?: string }`.
   - Call `getUser()`, verify role is 'employer'.
   - Load employer profile via `getEmployerProfile(user.id)`, verify status is 'approved'.
   - Parse formData: for array fields (specializations, bar, domains), use `formData.getAll('requiredSpecializations')` to get multiple values.
   - Validate with `CreateJobSchema.safeParse()`. On error, return `{ error: formatted validation errors }`.
   - Call `createJob()` from DAL with `employerUserId: user.id` and `createdBy: user.id`. Set initial status to 'draft'.
   - Call `revalidatePath('/employer/jobs')`.
   - Return `{ success: true, jobId }`.

2. `publishJobAction(jobId: string): Promise<ActionState>` -- Changes job status from 'draft' to 'open'. Only the owning employer can publish.
   - Verify user is employer, owns the job.
   - Call `updateJob(jobId, { status: 'open' })`.
   - Revalidate `/employer/jobs` and `/employer/jobs/${jobId}`.
   - Return `{ success: true }`.

3. `updateJobAction(prevState: ActionState | undefined, formData: FormData): Promise<ActionState>` -- Updates an existing job's requirements. Same validation as create. Also calls `invalidateMatchesForJob(jobId)` if any requirement fields changed (to trigger re-matching). Revalidates paths.

For all actions, follow the pattern from `checkout.ts`: getUser -> role check -> employer profile check -> business logic.

**In `src/components/jobs/job-form.tsx`:**

'use client' component.

Props: `{ mode: 'create' | 'edit'; initialData?: JobFormData; action: (prevState: ActionState, formData: FormData) => Promise<ActionState> }`

Build a form using shadcn/ui components. Fields:

1. **Title** -- `<Input>` with label
2. **Description** -- `<Textarea>` with label (optional)
3. **Required Specializations** -- Multi-select checkboxes. Use the same IP specialization list that exists in the codebase: Patent Prosecution, Patent Litigation, Trademark, Copyright, Trade Secrets, IP Litigation, Licensing/Technology Transfer. Each selected value becomes a hidden `<input type="hidden" name="requiredSpecializations" value={spec} />`. Display as a grid of `<Checkbox>` components.
4. **Preferred Specializations** -- Same multi-select pattern, same options list.
5. **Minimum Experience** -- `<Input type="number" min="0">` with label (optional, in years)
6. **Preferred Location** -- `<Input>` with label (free text, optional)
7. **Required Bar Admissions** -- Multi-select checkboxes with common values: USPTO, California, New York, Texas, Illinois, DC, Other. Use hidden inputs for form submission.
8. **Required Technical Domains** -- Multi-select checkboxes using existing technical domain categories from the codebase: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry, Biology/Biotech, Pharmaceutical, Materials Science. Hidden inputs for form submission.

Use `useActionState` with the passed `action` prop. Show validation errors from `state.error`. On success, redirect to `/employer/jobs` (or to `/employer/jobs/${state.jobId}` for create).

Use `useEffect` to redirect on `state.success` via `router.push()`.

Style: Follow existing form patterns in the codebase (employer registration form). Use `<Card>` wrapper, proper spacing, submit `<Button>` at bottom.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify both files compile. Verify createJobAction validates with Zod and checks employer approval. Verify the form component handles multi-select arrays properly via hidden inputs.</verify>
  <done>Server actions validate job creation/update/publish with Zod and employer auth. Form component renders all job requirement fields with multi-select support for specializations, bar admissions, and technical domains.</done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Create employer job pages and match results component, update nav</name>
  <files>src/app/(authenticated)/employer/jobs/page.tsx, src/app/(authenticated)/employer/jobs/new/page.tsx, src/app/(authenticated)/employer/jobs/[id]/page.tsx, src/components/jobs/match-results.tsx, src/app/(authenticated)/employer/nav.tsx</files>
  <action>
**In `src/app/(authenticated)/employer/jobs/page.tsx`:**

Server component. Pattern from `employer/browse/page.tsx`:
1. `getUser()` -> verify employer role + approved status
2. Call `getJobsByEmployer(user.id)` from DAL
3. Render a page with heading "My Jobs" and a "Create Job" link/button
4. If no jobs, show empty state: "You haven't created any job listings yet."
5. If jobs exist, render a list/table of jobs as cards or table rows:
   - Each row: Title, Status badge (draft/open/closed/archived with color coding), Match count, Created date
   - Click row/title links to `/employer/jobs/${job.id}`
   - Draft jobs show a "Publish" button (calls `publishJobAction`)
6. Use status color coding: draft=gray, open=green, closed=yellow, archived=red

**In `src/app/(authenticated)/employer/jobs/new/page.tsx`:**

Server component wrapper for the job form:
1. `getUser()` -> verify employer + approved
2. Render heading "Create Job Listing" with breadcrumb back to `/employer/jobs`
3. Render `<JobForm mode="create" action={createJobAction} />`
4. Import `createJobAction` from `@/actions/jobs`

**In `src/app/(authenticated)/employer/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`:**

Server component. Job detail page with match results.
1. `getUser()` -> verify employer + approved
2. Load job via `getJobById(params.id)` -- verify ownership (job.employerUserId === user.id)
3. If not found or not owned, `notFound()`
4. Display job details: title, description, all requirement fields as chips/badges
5. Show matching status section:
   - If `matchingStatus === 'pending'`: Show "Run Matching" button. This button triggers a client-side fetch to `POST /api/matching/run` with the jobId, then polls `/api/matching/status`. Use a client component for this interactive piece.
   - If `matchingStatus === 'running'`: Show "Matching in progress..." with a spinner. Auto-poll status.
   - If `matchingStatus === 'completed'`: Show match results via `<MatchResults>` component.
   - If `matchingStatus === 'failed'`: Show error message with "Retry" button.
6. Load matches via `getMatchesForJob(jobId)` if status is 'completed'.
7. Pass matches to `<MatchResults matches={matches} />`.

For the "Run Matching" / polling interaction, create a small client component `MatchingTrigger` within the same file (or as a separate component) that:
- Has a "Run Matching" button
- On click: calls `POST /api/matching/run` via fetch
- Then polls `GET /api/matching/status?jobId=xxx` every 2 seconds
- When status changes to 'completed', calls `router.refresh()` to reload server component data
- Shows appropriate loading state during matching

**In `src/components/jobs/match-results.tsx`:**

'use client' component (needs no client interactivity, but may want sorting later).

Actually, make it a server component. Props: `{ matches: JobMatchDTO[] }` where `JobMatchDTO` comes from the DAL.

Display matches as a list of cards, ordered by overallScore DESC:
1. Each match card shows:
   - **Overall Score** as a large number with color coding (75+: green, 50-74: yellow, 25-49: orange, 0-24: red)
   - **Recommendation** badge ("Strong Match", "Good Match", "Partial Match", "Weak Match") with matching colors
   - **Summary** text (2-3 sentences from Claude)
   - **Sub-scores** as a horizontal bar or grid: Specialization (30%), Experience (25%), Technical (20%), Bar (15%), Location (10%) -- each showing score/100 and one-line explanation
   - **Profile link**: "View Profile" link to `/employer/browse/${match.profileId}` so employer can see the anonymized (or unlocked) candidate profile
2. If no matches, show: "No matching candidates found. Try broadening your job requirements."
3. Show match count in header: "X candidates matched"

Use shadcn/ui `<Card>`, `<Badge>`, `<Progress>` components for clean display.

**In `src/app/(authenticated)/employer/nav.tsx`:**

Add a new nav link for Jobs between Browse and Saved:

```typescript
{ href: '/employer/jobs', label: 'Jobs', icon: Briefcase, exact: false },
```

Import `Briefcase` from `lucide-react`. Keep existing nav items, just add this one.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify all files compile. Verify the employer nav has a Jobs link. Verify the jobs list page loads jobs for the current employer. Verify the detail page shows match results when matching is completed.</verify>
  <done>Employer can navigate to Jobs via nav, see their job listings, create new jobs via form, view job details with match results. Match results show scores, recommendations, sub-scores, and summaries with profile links.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- Employer nav has Jobs link between Browse and Saved
- `/employer/jobs` renders job list for authenticated employer
- `/employer/jobs/new` renders job creation form with all requirement fields
- `/employer/jobs/[id]` renders job detail with match results section
- Server actions validate with Zod and check employer approval
- Match results component shows scores, recommendations, and sub-scores
- Only approved employers can access job features
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Employer can create a job listing with structured requirements, see their jobs in a list, view individual job details with AI-matched candidate results sorted by fit score with plain-English explanations.
</success_criteria>
